# Introduction

I am a grad-student from Mathematics coding since 2007. I also learned deep learning (tensorflow) techniques in 2016, which made me aspire to my most inner essence, become a ML engineer.

# Courses

I took the liberty of completing Deep Reinforcement Learning and Computer Vision degrees from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). And the Deep Learning Specialization from [Coursera](https://coursera.org).

Besides that, I also am an avid reader of technical books and literature so as to enable me to keep up to date and extend my skills.
